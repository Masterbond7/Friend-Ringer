Server:
	- Hosts website displaying online nodes & allows you to "ring" the nodes
	- Continuously waits for connections from nodes
		- If there is a connection display the node as online
		- If there is no connection for a set time (30 secs) display the node as offline
	- When the ring button is pressed on the website wait store that data in a variable, when the node connects, tell it to ring
	- If a node sends an init signal give it an ID

Nodes:
	- Connect to server every ~15 secs to check in
		- If the server cannot connect, show a red led
		- If there is a connection, send the node's ID and see if it has been rang
			- If it has, activate a peizo/bell/something else
		- To get ID send init signal
